This section\nis first because the LanguaMunity philosophy values\nimmersion so much as to encourage you to begin the\nimmersion part of your language learning as quickly\nas possible.\n\nWhile there is no guarantee of people extending to\nyou the acts of patience that you request, your\nchances of receiving such acts of patience are\ngreater if you know how to request them and to\nexplain why you need them than if you don't know\nhow to do so."
