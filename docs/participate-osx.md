# Participating as a MacOS X Tester of LanguaMunity at This Stage
__NOTE: This document isn't yet ready for anyone to use.
Please check back in a few days.__

An Open Source project such as LanguaMunity needs [help of all kinds](thanks.md).
One kind of help that is very much needed is for people to participate
as testers - people who will try it out and submit feedback by which
the project may improve.

This document details how users of MacOS X may participate in testing
this idea of LanguaMunity as it forms as well as the terminal-window implementation
of LanguaMunity.
