# Participating as a MacOS X Tester of LanguaMunity at This Stage
__NOTE: This document isn't yet ready for anyone to use.
Please check back in a few days.__

An Open Source project such as LanguaMunity needs [help of all kinds](thanks.md).
One kind of help that is very much needed is for people to participate
as testers - people who will try it out and submit feedback by which
the project may improve.

This document details how users of MacOS X may participate in testing
this idea of LanguaMunity as it forms as well as the terminal-window implementation
of LanguaMunity.

## Step 1 - Make Sure TextWrangler is Installed
If you have TextWrangler \(or it's full-featured
sister-project, BBEdit\) already installed on your
system, complete with the __edit__ user-command
\(and have verified that __edit__ works from your
command-line\)
you can skip this step.
Otherwise, this step is important.

There are two ways to install TextWrangler.
One is [through the app store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/textwrangler/id404010395?mt=12)
- though if you install it that way, you will still have to go to the program's
web-site in order to install the __edit__ user-command as it is not included
in the app-store edition of the program.

The other way is to
[download and install it yourself](http://www.barebones.com/support/textwrangler/updates.html)
- and if you do it this way, they probably are the ones who can tell you whether
or not you have to do an extra step to install the __edit__ user-command.

Either way, there may be additional instructions you have to follow to assure
that the __edit__ user-command is on the command-path, so that you can easily
use it from the command-line.

## Step 2 - Make sure Git is installed
If __git__ is not installed, you can
[download and install it from the Git-SCM web-site](https://git-scm.com/download/mac).

## Make sure the JSON CPAN module for PERL is installed
