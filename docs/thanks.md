# Some Words of Thanks
This document will probably prove inadequate in the area
of thanking all those without who's help LanguaMunity
could not have gotten even as far as it already is.
However, even though I am bound to leave out some
who deserve mention here (as it would be hard to remember
all off the top of my head)
I deem that it is better to express some words of thanks
than not to express any at all.

Though many thanks go regarding the LanguaMunity
project in general - the primary focus of this document
is on those who helped me put together content for this
experimental Spanish-language package.
It is still an ongoing project in it's early stages
(and as such, I hope the help will continue)
but I need to express thanks to those who have already
helped so far.
Knowing nothing more than a small few words and phrases
of Spanish going in to this project, I am having to
bootstrap the contents of this course while learning
Spanish myself.
In this endeavor, research tools (such as Google Translate)
are very helpful -- but they would still be inadequate
were it not for the fact that I am having the pleasure
of actual Spanish-speaking people coming to my aid.

For one thing, I would like to think Leon whom I know
from my home town for being the first Spanish-speaking
person who discussed with me anything on this project
of an experimental Spanish-for-English-speakers course
for LanguaMunity.

I also would like to thank the local Spanish-language discussion
group - especially the organizers who allow that group to
exist, as well as the few members of the group who have so far
been most enthusiastic in helping me get material to put into
this experimental course -- but also to thank the group as
a whole for being such a lovely environment to meet and
immerse myself in the Spanish language through conversation.

Also - at even this early stage, there are a few who have
volunteered to help this project by testing it.
Many people may not realize how vital this kind of
assistance is to any Open Source project.
Great thanks to those who have already volunteered to
help in that capacity -
[and I also extend an invitation for others to join them](help-test.md).

I would also like to thank the one person who has already
expressed interest in eventually preparing for LanguaMunity
a course to teach the French language.
