Experimental LanguaMunity Course - Spanish for English Speakers

## Experimental Nature of This Course
This course is being developed along-side the actual infrastructure of
LanguaMunity itself - and as such, it is unknown how much or how little
of this particular package will be used in the stable course once
LanguaMunity is in full operation.

Also - in addition to the LanguaMunity data files themselves, this
project will also contain scripts to allow testers to use this
package for until there is enough infrastructure estalished to
allow it to be used without such scripts.

Also - even contents of this package that will be incorporated into
a live-production package once LanguaMunity is up and running may
not necessarily be in the same location in this package as they
will be in the final package.

## Thanks
Though I may not succeed, I am at least
[doing my best to thank those who are helping this effort](docs/thanks.md).
